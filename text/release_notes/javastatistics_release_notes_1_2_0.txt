JavaStatistics 1.2.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Features

- Validation reports now include details about the
study design.  Reports are produced in LaTeX and typeset
by the build.  A new resources directory contains the
associated LaTeX class.

Dependency Changes

- Upgraded to Apache Commons Math version 3.0.

Bug Fixes

- Now returns a -1 with an error code for sample size when 
there is no difference between the groups.  In this case, no
sample size, however large, can detect a difference.  Consequently,
the most appropriate power value is the Type I Error rate.
- Improved detection of search boundaries in bisection search 
for sample size.  Searches for lower bound to avoid approximation
failures in the Hotelling-Lawley trace for very small sample sizes.
Also stops at MAX_INT for the upper bound. 

Known Issues

- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values.
